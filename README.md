# nlp_classification

## Notes

- For scoring our model, we use F1 score on the dev set as if it is a test set. Should do a further split of train into train/val so that dev is held out.
- They expect us to provide a *GitLab* SHA commit number, although no GitLab repo seems to have been set up for us
- Must provide dev.txt and test.txt output files
